# github-actions

This repository contains a collection of GitHub Actions that I have created.

## Jobs in this repository

- [hello](.github/workflows/hello.yml): A simple job that prints "Hello, world!" to the console.

## Usage

To use these actions in your own repository, you can copy the workflow files from this repository into your own repository. For example, to use the `hello` job, you can copy the contents of the [hello.yml](.github/workflows/hello.yml) file into a new file in your repository at `.github/workflows/hello.yml`.
